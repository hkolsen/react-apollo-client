## Exploration with the Apollo Client

This project is based on the GraphQL Apollo Client Course featured as a free Community Resource on [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-data-in-react-with-apollo-client). I refactored the app to use functional components and hooks instead of classes.

In order to run the client you need to seed the DB and run the server beforehand.

```
cd server
yarn
yarn seed
yarn start:slow
```

Then install your dependencies and run the app on your localhost.
```
yarn
yarn start
```
